\section{Introduction}
\label{chap1:sec1}

It is a commonplace, in academia and popular culture, that ideas spread like diseases: they can be ``infectious'' or ``go viral.''  The proposition is hardly new; as \cite{shiller2017narrative} points out, it can be found at least as far back as \cite{humeenquiry},
whose ideas thoroughly infected the work of his friend \cite{smithwealth}.\footnote{See \cite{rasmussen2017infidel}.} Indeed, %with one notable exception (see below),
in fields other than economics, the debates are rarely about whether social interactions are fundamental; the main question is which particular models for capturing social interactions are most suitable for understanding the spread of which kinds of ideas.

``Expectations'' are just a category of ideas.  So upon being told that expectations play a critical role in structural economic modeling, a scholar who was not an economist might suppose that epidemiological models of  expectations would be a standard part of the economist's modeling toolkit --- unless there were good reason to suppose that economic ideas are immune to social influence.

But evidence for social transmission of economic ideas is plentiful and has recently been growing by leaps and bounds -- see Section~\ref{subsec:microEvidence}.  Still, it would not be accurate to say that an `epidemiological expectations' (`EE') approach is a standard way of constructing formal models of economic phenomena -- as a conventional off-the-shelf alternative, say, to a `rational expectations' (`RE') approach, the `Rational Inattention' (`RI') approach advocated by~\cite{sims2003implications}, or even to the `diagnostic expectations' model of~\cite{bordalo2018diagnostic}, or a number of bounded rationality approaches (e.g.,~\cite{gabaix2020behavioral} or \cite{ilut2020economic}).

This is perhaps because nowhere has any careful attempt been made to define what would constitute a full-fledged EE treatment of an economic question.\footnote{A methodology in cultural economics called `the epidemiological approach' seeks to identify cultural variations in the same way epidemiologists sometimes identify latent disease risks: By a person's place of origin, or other observable exogenous traits that might be markers of cultural attitudes.  Since this approach does not aim to study the transmission of expectations by social interactions, we see little danger of its being confused with what we define as EE modeling.}  Despite this handicap, there have been some notable examples of what we would describe as full-fledged EE approaches, which we define as requiring the following elements:% (in addition to whatever would be included regardless of how expectations were modeled):
\begin{verbatimwrite}{./Slides/FullFledgedEE}
  \begin{quote}\normalfont
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item a mechanism: \ifthenelse{\boolean{Slides}}{math by which idea(s) transmitted}{An explicit and rigorous mathematical description of a social interaction process by which ideas are transmitted among agents  ...}
    \item implying expectational dynamics: \ifthenelse{\boolean{Slides}}{
        ... that yields observable $\mathbb{E}$ dynamics ...
      }
      {... that generates observable expectation dynamics at the level of individuals or populations~...}
    \item with economic consequences: \ifthenelse{\boolean{Slides}}{... those $\mathbb{E} \Rightarrow$ an economic outcome}{
        ... and those expectations have knock-on consequences for an observable outcome (often, prices, quantities, or market values) that is the primary subject of the economic analysis.}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
\end{verbatimwrite}
\input{./Slides/FullFledgedEE}
These criteria whittle down a vast number of invocations, or partial discussions, of the proposition that ideas spread through social interaction to the surprisingly small number of papers on which we primarily focus here.  (The last criterion allows us to neglect enormous literatures on public opinion, politics, musical tastes, internet memes, and other topics).

We have identified three fields in economics -- technological diffusion (section ~\ref{subsec:techDiffusion}), financial markets (section ~\ref{subsec:assetprice}), and macroeconomics (section ~\ref{subsec:macroExp}), in which there is a set of papers that satisfy all these criteria -- even if in some cases the work has not been mainly thought of as `epidemiological' until now.\footnote{Ironically, these literatures claiming that ideas succeed by contagion have developed largely in isolation, judging at least by the almost complete independence of the citation networks connecting them (see our figure~\ref{fig:graph_mixer}). The only paper that is cited by all three of the literatures is the foundational paper by \cite{kermack_contribution_1927}.}  In addition, we survey the proliferating work providing evidence that social interactions drive expectations and corresponding behaviors (section~\ref{subsec:microEvidence}); draw the connection between the EE approach and a separate yet related literature on financial contagion (section ~\ref{subsec:Contagion}); and present a selection of research on the spreading of news and rumors, scientific ideas and online content, most of which has been performed by scholars outside of economics (section~\ref{subsec:nonecon}).\footnote{Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large literature has sprung up in which economists have directly modeled COVID itself as a disease, or modeled the economic consequences of the disease; this work of course does meet our criteria, but some of it -- e.g. \cite{gourieroux2020time} -- contains interesting techniques for modeling the spread of the disease which could potentially be repurposed for modeling the spread of ideas.}

\section{Background and Motivation}\label{motivation-and-context}

\subsection{Expectational Heterogeneity}\label{EpiExpHet}\hypertarget{EpiExpHet}{}

In their introduction to the
\begin{verbatimwrite}{./Slides/QuoteBrowningHansenHeckman1999}%%%Slides
  \textit{Handbook of Microeconomics}, \href{http://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Microdata-and-GE-Models.pdf}{Browning, Heckman, and Hansen [\citeyear{browning_chapter_1999}}], wrote that the most universal lesson of micro economics is that ``people are different in ways that importantly affect their economic behavior.''
\end{verbatimwrite}%%%Slides
\input{./Slides/QuoteBrowningHansenHeckman1999}%%%Slides

\begin{verbatimwrite}{./Slides/QuoteHandbookOfMacro}
  \textit{Handbook of Macroeconomics}, \cite{kmpHandbook}: ``Macroeconomics and Household Heterogeneity'';  \cite{violante_marginal_2021} Laffont lecture on MPC Heterogeneity

  \pause \indent ~~~~~OK, heterogeneity also importantly affects ``macroeconomic'' behavior

\end{verbatimwrite}

Over the subsequent two decades, a great deal of the progress in macro economics has come from incorporating microeconomic heterogeneity ``in ways that importantly affect'' macroeconomic behavior.  (See ``Macroeconomics and Heterogeneity'' in the latest \textit{Handbook of Macroeconomics}, \cite{kmpHandbook}).  In particular, Heterogeneous Agent  (`HA-Macro') models that match the distributions of income and wealth have now provided rigorous microfoundations for Keynesian macroeconomics by capturing measured heterogeneity in (and a large average value for) the marginal propensity to consume -- see \cite{violante_marginal_2021}'s Laffont lecture.

% \subsubsection{Expectational Heterogeneity Is Rarely Modeled}\label{Expectational-heterogeneity-is-rarely-modeled}\hypertarget{expectational-heterogeneityIsRarelyModeled}

But only a few structural models in the HA-Macro literature have allowed for differences in agents' expectations about variables like stock returns (where everyone's realized outcome will be identical) -- even though disagreements on such subjects are rife and people make choices that correspond to their expressed beliefs (\cite{gmsuBeliefs}).\footnote{One of the few examples is \cite{Velasquez2022}, who shows that household portfolio choice models yield much more reasonable results when the model is calibrated with survey respondents' actual measured stock market expectations than when calibrated, as usual, under the assumption that all households hold beliefs identical to those that economists have estimated in scholarly literature.}

Partly, the failure of modelers to incorporate expectational heterogeneity may reflect the fact that until recently there was not widespread awareness among macroeconomists that measurable expectation differences have considerable power to explain observable microeconomic behavioral differences.  Evidence of the recent change in attitudes can be seen in the published discussions in the 2017 \textit{NBER Macroeconomics Annual} of~\cite{manski2017survey}'s paper surveying the literature on the measurement of expectations (in which Manski himself has been the leading figure, and until recently something of a lone voice crying in the wilderness).  %Aside from the warm reception of Manski's paper both by his NBER discussants and by the conference attendees, o
Other signs of the profession's new interest in the measurement of expectations are developments like the commissioning of this \emph{Handbook}, the creation of the \emph{Survey of Consumer Expectations} by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2014 (and several similar surveys or pilots in Canada, Europe, and elsewhere (see {\bdkhouseholdFull} for a list of such surveys), and the fact that expectational questions have begun to be added to existing surveys like the ones used for calibrating HA-Macro models.  %The HRS, for example, collects expectations about stock returns, and~\cite{mv77PortfolioNonPuzzle} shows both that HRS respondents are systematically pessimistic (relative to economists's views) and that the more pessimistic a respondent is, the less likely they are to invest.

But EE modeling approaches may be particularly appealing now as a result of the emergence of new \emph{kinds} of data.  In particular, for the first time ever, it is now becoming possible to directly observe economic expectations spreading over social networks -- as in the papers we describe below by~\cite{bailey2018economic, bailey2019house}.

\subsection{Epistemology and Epidemiology}

One aspect of the EE approach that seems to trouble economists more than scholars from other fields is the requirement to specify a source for the idea(s) whose spread is being modeled.

The Rational Expectations approach gets around this problem by making some rather bold assumptions (there is only one `true' model of the world; everyone believes the same true model; everyone observes an identical set of facts and draws the same conclusions from them; everyone \emph{knows} that everyone believes ... ; and so on).  %The reward for this steep price is that often RE models have a unique and testable equilibrium.

% Such models are often challenging to understand and analyze, and is not unreasonable to worry that adding additional complexity derived from an epidemiological mechanism of belief transmission would yield a system almost impossible to make sense of.
An appealing way to move forward is for epidemiological models to be built to be `tunable' in the degree to which they differ from better-understood models.  This should not be hard:  If the only `source' of ideas is an agent who believes in the rational expectations solution, and the infection rate is 100 percent, the solution will be the rational expectations solution.  It will then be possible to pin down, step by step, the reasons for any deviation between the EE and the corresponding RE model.

In fact, most of the examples of EE models we highlight below are of this kind: There is some parameter or set of parameters which can be set to zero (or some other specific value), causing the model to collapse to an off-the-shelf rational expectations model.%  See section~\ref{subsec:macroExp} for discussion of some specific examples.

\begin{comment}
  The literature's many informal references to epidemiological ideas indicate  that economists are familiar with these ideas and find them tempting.  The hesitancy to adopt explicitly epidemiological methods in the analysis of standard economic questions therefore seems unlikely to reflect a consensus that there are no plausible epidemiological models; it seems more  likely to reflect a concern that there are too many.  Without considerable further discipline beyond the proposition that `ideas spread like diseases' it is not unreasonable to worry about whether an `epidemiological expectations' approach is sufficiently well defined to be worth exploring.
  % \subsubsection{Why Identical Rational Expectations Remain the Default}\label{subsubsec:expectations-are-heterogeneous}\hypertarget{WhyIdentical RationalExpectationsRemainTheDefault}{}
  ``Rational Expectations'' (`RE') -- which in this context really means `identical expectations' --  remains a default at least partly because it usually can generate unique and testable predictions for the dynamics of aggregate variables.

  But several counterpoints are worth emphasizing.

  The first is that expectations are \textit{measurable}, and increasingly measured in the kinds of micro datasets used to calibrate and simulate HA-macro models.  All survey data (including income and wealth) need to be treated carefully to guard against measurement problems, and the extensive literature on the measurement of expectations suggests that those data should be treated with particular care -- but also demonstrates that robust information is contained in the answers to such questions.

  Thus, EE models have a source of discipline unavailable in the RE framework. This fact could help counter concerns about whether such models provide too many degrees of freedom to be usefully testable.


  % -- even if solving RA models in the presence of nonexpectational heterogeneity (wealth; income) is a major challenge.  %But the HA-Macro literature has helped macroeconomists get comfortable with results that emerge from the simulation of large populations of agents all of whom are in different circumstances.


  RE also corresponds rather directly to philosophers' traditional formulation of how humans can come to know things: A solitary reasoner has some fundamental assumptions about the world and makes logical/mathematical deductions to construct beliefs about things not directly observable (like, the future).\footnote{See Bertrand~\citep{russell1946history} for a history that traces these ideas all the way back to Plato and Aristotle.}%\footnote{\cite{broad1952ethics} is a descendant of Hume's: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction}{``Induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy''.}}

  Yet even in philosophy there is a growing recognition that most knowledge that people (think they) possess cannot possibly be so hard-core.  As \cite{coady1992testimony}, an early advocate of ``social epistemology,'' puts it, many of us have never directly observed the delivery of a baby, yet we have firm convictions about how it happens.  And most of us have not mastered the skills necessary to prove by personal observation of sunrises and sunsets (and intricate mathematical deduction) that the Earth is (roughly) spherical.  We believe that the Earth is spherical, and a great many other things, because to a large degree we trust the testimony of other people who tell us that they have collected the facts and done the math.

  % In some cases, the RE equilibrium is the eventual limit of a process of social interaction (a model of scientific belief transmission may imply that there are fewer members of the Flat Earth Society with each passing year).  But even in those epidemiological models where convergence occurs, a difference with the RE model is that the process of reaching consensus takes time rather than being instantaneous.

  % Keynes quotes:

  % "If we speak frankly, we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of a patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a building in the City of London amounts to little and sometimes to nothing"

  % "Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a mathematical expectation, whether moral or hedonistic or economic. Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of ``animal spirits'' of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by probabilities"

  % The sensible question, then, is how best to model the ways in which external sources of information produce individuals' beliefs. %This is the potential point of entry for epidemiological models:  As a mathematical or computational matter, there is little difference in the set of ways in which information might be transmitted from person to person (or common source to person) and the ways in which infection might be transmitted.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Epidemiology on Networks}\label{subsec:epiNet}
% \subsubsection{Consequences of Social Transmission}\label{subsubsec:Consequences-of-Social-Transmission}\hypertarget{ConsequencesOfSocialTransmission}{}

For short, we use the word `classical' to refer to epidemiological models that descend from the work of \cite{kermack_contribution_1927}, who formulated the problem as one of tracking the size of `compartments' of the population in different disease states (like susceptible or infected) under a `random mixing' assumption in which all members of the population were equally likely to encounter each other in a time interval.  Along with the use of continuous time and real numbers for the compartment sizes, the random mixing assumption allowed the problem to be described by a set of differential equations that could be solved numerically even in 1927.

A newer literature also examines the social transmission of beliefs and satisfies any reasonable interpretation of  an `epidemiological' approach:  A large body of work using the tools of `network theory' studies models in which the `nodes' in a graph are interpreted as people and the `edges' are social connections between nodes.  \cite{erdos1960evolution} originated this literature with a model in which connections among agents were a `random graph' (the analog of the `random mixing' assumption), so the only parameter was `degree': the number of connections each agent had.  Subsequent work relaxed random graph assumption, allowing meaningful definition of an agent's `neighbors,' and showed that a `clustering coefficient' is a useful measurement of the extent to which a person's neighbors know each other.  These tools allow the researcher to consider any measurable type of connection -- not restricted to geography or workplace or any other narrow category.\footnote{A standard reference for economists is the textbook by~\cite{jackson_social_2010}.}

% \footnote{The mathematical formulation of network theory, or graph theory (the boundary between these is porous) is usually attributed to Leonhard Euler, in his solution to a problem of geography -- the ``Bridges of Konigsberg.''}

While the classical and the network-theory approaches seem quite different, it turns out that network theory tools can be configured to produce an arbitrarily close approximation to the classical problem (see our example in Section~\ref{subsec:shillerpound} below).  But networks can also be used to study a great many other essentially epidemiological questions that could not even be formulated in the classical setup. % (Network theory has also been used to study a wide range of questions in game theory and other fields quite distant from epidemiology.)

% \subsubsection{Its A Small World After All}\label{subsubsec:Its-A-Small-World-After-All}\hypertarget{ItsASmallWorldAfterAll}{}

One well-known network-theory result that (to some extent) helps bridge the classical and the network approaches is the ``Small World'' effect explained by~\cite{wsSmallWorld}, who show that even when the `clustering coefficient' is high, a small sprinkling of random links to `distant' nodes has remarkable power to make a network `completely connected' (or nearly so).  \cite{barabasi2016network}'s summary is that when network models are calibrated to match facts about human connections (or, for that matter, internet links), the ``interconnectedness'' phenomenon is extremely robust.

This provides a satisfying explanation for a phenomenon first documented by \cite{milgram1967small}, who famously found that, on average, any two randomly selected people in the U.S.\ population were able to identify intermediate links of personal friends and friends-of-friends (and so on) by which they were connected, with the typical length of the chain involving only six people.\footnote{This provides another example of crossover appeal in popular culture, having spawned John \cite{guareSixDegrees}'s play \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Separation_(play)}{`Six Degrees of Separation'} a  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Separation_(film)}{movie} adaptation, a popular \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon}{parlor game}, and other byproducts like calculators for the \href{https://oakland.edu/enp/}{degrees of separation between academics}).}  For our purposes, the interesting insight is that the ``Small Worlds'' phenomenon may suggest that the `random mixing' assumption in classical epidemiological models may not be as problematic as it might seem at first.

The `small worlds' phenomenon also provides a plausible mathematical explanation for the `strength of weak ties' phenomenon (\cite{granovetter1973strength}) according to which jobfinding through a social network most often happens through a distantly connected person.  The key feature of such `weak ties' is that they connect the job-seeker to many opportunities not known to those in the job-seeker's immediate `cluster.'

% Although it is not usually motivated that way, a useful alternative foundation for the `identical foundations' approach can easily be constructed in a world where people trust external sources.

% A vast literature outside of economics has investigated questions of this kind, as applied to topics like the diffusion of scientific knowledge~\cite{bettencourt2006power} or religious beliefs (\cite{hayward2018mathematical}).

% The key point is best understood as follows.

% A large literature in mathematics, beginning with \cite{erdos1960evolution}, has developed the pure theory, and more recently computational tools have allowed numerical investigations, but a fair distillation of much of this work would be to say

% In this light, the fact that there are a few remaining members of the Flat Earth Society could be interpreted as evidence in favor of the philosopher-economist's point of view; those might be the unlucky people who made a math mistake which implied a pancake-shaped Earth, which could maybe be described as ``flat.''  Their imperviousness to the testimony of others could be interpreted as exemplifying people's ability to reach their own conclusions without regard to the common opinion of the crowd.

% But the fact that almost everyone is ``connected'' in this sense is hardly sufficient to justify a conclusion that everyone has identical beliefs about everything.  That would require very strong auxiliary assumptions about the nature of communications across links.

A distinct advantage of the `network' approach over the classical epidemiological approach is the extent to which, especially with modern computational tools, a network modeler can examine the consequences of almost arbitrarily rich assumptions about the exact nature of interactions between agents.  A key theme of the network literature is that even in a fully connected world, it is easy to construct models in which disagreement persists indefinitely (\cite{acemouglu2013opinion}) and subpopulations converge to different beliefs~(\cite{sikder2020minimalistic}).%  (The `clustering coefficient' is often -- though not always -- important).

% that would follow only under a host of additional assumptions which have widely varying plausibility for different kinds of knowledge or information transmission.  As a result, our survey will highlight models that deviate in interesting ways from the framework specified above.

\subsection{Expectational Tribes}\label{subsec:ExpTribes}

The fact that epidemiological models can easily imply that subgroups can settle into permanently different points of view is inconvenient from a modeling perspective.  If there were no evidence that persistent differences of opinion could matter for important economic decisions, the case for using the epidemiological modeling toolkit would be weaker.  We therefore conclude this section on `background and motivation' by presenting some evidence of a recent clear failure of `identical beliefs' with consequences for measured choices in an area core to both micro and macro modeling: financial risk-taking.

\href{https://github.com/iworld1991/EpiExp/blob/master/Literature/meeuwis2018belief.pdf}{\cite{meeuwis2018belief}}, using a dataset on millions of retirement investors from a large financial institution, show that after Donald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S.\ 2016 Presidential election, investors likely to be affiliated with Republican Party (inferred from  campaign donations at the zip code level) increased the equity share in their portfolio, while (likely) Democrats rebalanced into safe assets. (See~Figure~\ref{fig:parker}.)  These choices occurred at exactly the same time that consumer sentiment surveys showed that self-identified Republicans had suddenly become more optimistic, and Democrats more pessimistic, about the economy's prospects over the next few years.\footnote{The New York Fed \href{https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/12/political-polarization-in-consumer-expectation'}{blog post} \textit{``Political Polarization in Consumer Expectations''} also provides evidence for partisan differences in consumer expectations.}$^{,}$\footnote{Of course as is the case in many settings, the cause of changes in beliefs, here the election outcome, is also a potential cause of changes in objective economic circumstances.  The paper makes use of its rich data to provide strong evidence that differences in circumstances such as local economic conditions or hedging needs are not driving the results. In particular, investment behavior differs by political affiliation even among people living in the same county and working at the same firm, and after controlling for many other individual-level characteristics.}


% The paper's rich dataset allows the authors to persuasively rule out non-belief-based channels (like income hedging needs, preferences, or local economic exposure). %Moreover, such differences in investment behaviors are found for investors working at the same employer and living in the same county.

% After we articulate alternative epidemiological models of the spread of ideas, we will be in a position to discuss how evidence of this kind can be useful in winnowing the field of models.

% Some remaining assumptions that could justify an `identical expectations' equilibrium would be (1) there is a single, unambiguous truth about the state of the world; (2) all agents who make an observation about the world would perceive the same truth; (3) all agents truthfully communicate all their observations to all their links instantaneously; (4) everyone agrees about the correct model of how the world works.'

% These assumptions effectively resurrect the identical expectations equilibrium in a framework where social communications exist, but achieve instantaneous and complete homogeneity in beliefs.  We can think of all of the epidemiological/network models discussed below as deviations, in one respect or another, from this perfect-trust instantaneous-transmission perfect-agreement framework.


\section{What insights can the epidemiological framework
  offer?}\label{what-insights-can-the-epidemiological-framework-offer}

\subsection{What Is an Epidemiological Framework?}
\label{subsec:epi_framework}

We will say that ideas, beliefs, `narratives,' or other mental states that can affect behavior (henceforth, `expectations' are shorthand for all of these) result from an ``epidemiological'' process whenever they are modeled as resulting from some social interaction.

This is a slightly narrower scope than the mechanisms encompassed in textbook
definitions of epidemiology, which can include the study of diseases that develop without any identifiable external influence.  The category of epidemiological models we are interested in is those for ``transmissible'' diseases.

But the transmission need not be person-to-person.   ``Common source''  diseases do not involve any one-on-one contact; for example, cosmic radiation to which everyone is exposed can cause diseases like cancer.  % People living in caves would be less susceptible; those on mountaintops, more.
In the context of expectation formation a natural interpretation of such a ``common source'' is news media (a point to which we return below).

\begin{comment}
  Having clarified this boundary, epidemiological models that are relevant for us vary in a few fundamental ways:
  \begin{quote}\normalfont
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item the states that agents could possibly experience
    \item the process by which an agent's state can change via social communication
    \item the channels of social communication
    \item heterogeneity or evolution over time that affects any of these
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
\end{comment}
Probably the simplest epidemiological model is a `common source SI model.'  In this case a continuous population is divided into two `compartments': Persons in compartment `I' have been infected with the disease (and can never recover), while persons in compartment `S' are not yet infected.  The mathematical expression of the `common source' assumption is simply that the probability that any particular susceptible person will become infected is time-independent.  %(If the model is specified in continuous time, it is a Poisson process; in discrete time, Bernoulli).

For a population that begins at discrete date zero with a susceptible population of size 1, the dynamics are given by Table~\ref{table:SIDyn}, with the obvious implication that as $n$ approaches infinity the entire population eventually becomes infected.

\begin{verbatimwrite}{./Tables/SIDynCS}
  \begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{ ~Common Source SI Model}\label{table:SIDyn} \medskip
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      \hline
      Date $t$ & Susceptible$_t$ & Infected$_t$ \\
      \hline
      0 & $1$  &  $0$ \\
      \hline
      1 & $(1-p)\phantom{^2}$ & $1-(1-p)\phantom{^2}$ \\
      \hline
      2 & $(1-p)^{2}$ & $1-(1-p)^{2}$ \\
      \hline
      $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ \\
      \hline
      $n$ & $(1-p)^{n}$ & $1-(1-p)^{n}$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{verbatimwrite}
\input{./Tables/SIDynCS}

This modeling framework can be extended in many directions.  The usual next step is to have the disease be transmitted from agent to agent by `random mixing' which leads to the most familiar subclass of the SI modeling family, in which each susceptible person who encounters an infected person becomes infected at a rate $\beta$ in each period. Then in the discrete-time formulation, given a non-zero initial infected fraction $I_0$, the fraction  infected and susceptible evolve as described in Table \ref{table:SIDynTrans}.

      0 & $S_0$  &  $I_0$ \\
      \hline
      1 & $S_0 - \beta S_0I_0$ & $I_0+\beta S_0I_0$ \\
      \hline
      2 & $S_1-\beta S_1I_1$ & $I_1+\beta S_1I_1$ \\
      \hline
      $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ \\
      \hline
      $n$ & $S_{n-1}-\beta S_{n-1}I_{n-1}$ & $I_{n-1}+\beta S_{n-1}I_{n-1}$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{verbatimwrite}
\input{./Tables/SIDynTrans}

The best-known epidemiological framework adds one more potential state to ``susceptible'' and ``infected'':  `R' can be used to designate either recovery or `removal' (via, say, death); this yields the rich set of `SIR' models first proposed by \cite{kermack_contribution_1927}, who formulated the transition equations as a system of continuous-time nonlinear differential equations.

The SIR model has rich and interesting implications, such as the potential for `herd immunity' which comes about when a high enough proportion of the population has either Recovered or otherwise been Removed (say, by vaccination) from the pool of those susceptible to infection.

Unfortunately, the model's equations do not have finite closed-form analytical solutions,\footnote{\cite{miller2012note} and \cite{harko2014exact}  produce alternative formulations of what they call analytical solutions -- see   \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology\#Transition_rates}{this Wikipedia page} -- but both involve an integral that can only be calculated numerically, so neither is available in closed form.  These amount to convenient modern restatements of the original \cite{kermack_contribution_1927} model.} so implications must be obtained using numerical computational procedures -- though with current computational technologies such computations for the original \cite{kermack_contribution_1927} model have negligible cost.

Potential modeling choices proliferate from there.\footnote{For a general introduction to these model basics, we refer the reader to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology\#Transition_rates}{this Wikipedia page}. Epidemiologists use the term `compartmental models' refer to models in which people transition between states like susceptible and infected.  References to such models include	 \href{https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118}{\cite{kermack_contribution_1927}},  \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3710332/}{\cite{bailey1975mathematical}}, \href{https://www.amazon.com/Infectious-Diseases-Humans-Dynamics-Control/dp/019854040X}{\cite{anderson_infectious_1992}}, \href{https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0036144500371907}{\cite{hethcote_mathematics_2000}}, \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001967/}{\cite{brauer2017mathematical}}.}  A framework in which there are two possible outcomes of the infection, recovery or death, receives the acronym SIRD.  If the disease is one in which it is necessary to track the proportion who have been Exposed but are not yet (and may never become) infected, the result is an SEIR model -- and so on.

% Some variants do not have additional states but allow additional transitions among the states already treated (presumably, except for state `D'). For instance, the SIS model allows the infected (I) to transit back to susceptible (S) if immunity to the disease declines after some time.

One standard assumption for all of these models is that agents are \textit{ex-ante} homogeneous, but the classical framework can be extended to permit various kinds of heterogeneity -- at the considerable cost of adding whole new systems of nonlinear differential equations.  An advantage of the network approach is that since it is solved by simulation, modifications of the model are much easier to make because they do not add new systems of simultaneous differential equations to be solved.

% Another extension of these models incorporates the possibility that some agents may take protective actions to change the transition probabilities, instead of taking them all as exogenous.

% We will stop our description of the  epidemiological literature here because our purpose was more to introduce the kinds of modeling assumptions that are often considered there.

% Some of the disease states above have a natural interpretation in a model of expectations: A person who has adopted an idea from someone else can be said to have been `infected' by that idea.  Some are less natural; e.g., there is usually not an obvious analog in expectations models of the `recovered' state. % (though our survey below will describe some examples).

% The art of building a good model boils down to the choices articulated above: states, transitions, and the nature of heterogeneity.

% In some dimensions, close analogies can be drawn between the two applications.  Like an infected disease, an idea/opinion/certain view of the economy can spread via interpersonal contacts from those who have held it already, i.e. the infected (I) to those who are exposed to it (E) or who are potentially receptive to them (S), and it may also be forgotten, i.e. recovery (R).  Furthermore, the agents could be either ex-ante homogeneous or heterogeneous and the transmission of the expectations could be specific to agent types and their locations in the network.

\subsubsection{Adapting the Disease Metaphor to Expectations}\label{subsubsec:AdaptingTheModel}
\hypertarget{AdaptingTheModel}{}

Epidemiologists are usually interested in studying the dynamics of a single disease in a population, with a natural terminal stage like recovery or death.  Economists will often be interested in keeping track of how expectations change about an aggregate variable like stock prices, which does not have a terminal point and in which many competing opinions may infect different people at the same time.

Another advantage of the network theory formulation of epidemiological models is that it can easily accommodate dimensions in which an economic application may call for such modifications.  It is a trivial matter to represent as many competing `diseases' (theories of stock prices) as desired, and there is no need to specify a `recovery' state.

To take a more complex example, in classical epidemiological models it would be painful (though possible) to capture dynamics of a disease in which people become  `more infected' after repeated contact with other infected people.  But in a network model, it is easy to capture the proposition that a person may need to be exposed to an idea more than a certain number of times, or from more than a given number of sources, before they will adopt it -- as proposed in \cite{granovetter1978threshold}, and as implemented in \cite{jackson2007diffusion}. \footnote{See the interesting discussion of such `threshold models' in \cite{glasserman2016contagion}.}

% Another direction that epidemiological expectations models constructed by economists might take is to consider the implications of purposive behavior that might enhance (or impede) the flow of information.  For example, the widely used Michigan Survey of Consumers asks respondents their views on long term interest rates. If the respondent is one who recently bought a house, they may have deliberately `infected' themselves by doing some research on mortgage interest rates; in that case they might resemble a fully informed  agent.  But after the homebuyer has obtained a mortgage, there may be little  reason  for them to pay attention to long run interest rates.  It is not implausible that their views on rates will be shaped passively by random encounters with news sources or friends -- encounters that are better understood with an epidemiological framework than in a model in which the consumer is either perpetually fully informed or, for that matter, perpetually calculating the exact degree to which it would be optimal for them to choose to be fully informed.

% But there should be limits.  For EE as a framework to be sufficiently well-defined to be useful as an alternative to RE or other general-purpose expectational frameworks, it seems likely that it will be necessary to rule out the complexities that can arise in game theoretic uses of network theory.    The natural way to do that is to assume that consumers believe themselves to be infinitesimal:  They believe that they do not, personally, have the ability to affect equilibrium outcomes that matter to them.

% Using the foregoing introduction as a high-level map and definition of terms, our next section explores in some detail the varieties of ``epidemiological'' modeling strategies that have been used (or could be used) for economic modeling.

\begin{comment}% Not sure what good this "plausible applications" section does here -- maybe move to conclusion?
  \subsection{Plausible Applications of Existing  Tools to Economics}

  We begin by sketching, among the many directions the epidemiological literatures have already explored, the ones likely to be most useful to economists.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item  How geography structures the connections between people
  \item The structures of social networks as measured by social media connections
  \item  Consequences of heterogeneity in, say, likelihood of infection given exposure
  \item  Characteristics of models in which people's views do not converge but instead may result in groups of like-minded people \citep{meeuwis2018belief}.
  \end{itemize}

  The explicit end goal of much recent work has been to construct models that can match some of the newly available forms of data that we can increasingly map in high fidelity.

  % Math
  % While the original model of \cite{kermack_contribution_1927} and its immediate descendants were represented by simple differential equations that could be analyzed by hand, today's epidemiological models have become so complex that they cannot be studied effectively with pen and paper.  Instead, the details of the framework are constructed, then a population of simulated agents is created who abide by those rules of the game, and the population is simulated computationally in order to determine the model's implications.  (Reference the notebook again).  A paper is viewed as a finished contribution if it matches some of the patterns in a dataset.

  A highly cited example \cite{bauckhage2011insights} which uses a variety of epidemiological models in an attempt to explain the dynamics of
  popular internet ``memes.'' The attempt meets with some success in the sense that the author finds some examples in which one of the many
  variants of the SIR, SIER, and epidemiological frameworks seem to (ex post) be able to match the spread of, say, a photograph of a laughing baby, or the ``montauk monster.''  Much of the analysis has been somewhat solipsistic, in the sense that there is often not any attempt to measure (much less to model) knock-on consequences for variables other than the information itself.

  A more recent literature has examined the differential rates at which different kinds of ``news'' spreads, reaching an interesting conclusion that ``misinformation'' seems to spread more readily than true stories\citep{vosoughi_spread_2018}. And there is a rapidly growing literature on potential implications of the spread of ideas for political outcomes like election victories \citep{allcott2017social, grinberg2019fake} -- though even papers in that literature often do not present an integrated analysis of the structural mechanisms of the epidemiological process with the empirical consequences at the ballot box.

  And we are not aware of any papers in this vast literature in which there is a mapping from the structure of a model to an economic outcome that is a consequence of that structure, much less of a fully rounded model that explores the ramifications of that economic outcome on future dynamics of ideas.

  The best way to view all of this is probably as an arbitrage opportunity: Economists can take models of belief dynamics created in this literature and plug them into an economic model to determine their consequences (if any) for an economic phenomenon of interest, with standard economic modeling supplying the elements of the criteria above (like feedback between the spread of ideas and the economic outcomes) that are missing from the existing literature.

The bulk of this section discusses the three literatures mentioned in the introduction as having examples of full-fledged EE modeling (a map of all three literatures is in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_mixer}).  In the remainder we address a miscellany of topics including some interesting evidence for the epidemiological mechanisms of the transmission of economic expectations; the relationship of epidemiology to what are called models of `contagion' in economics and finance; and the highlights of the application of epidemiological models to the spread of information outside economics.

\subsection{Literature Summation}

We have barely scratched the surface of the scholarly literature with interesting evidence about the ways in which social interactions shape population beliefs.  Even within economics, where the topic has received less attention than might be expected, there is so much material that we are confident that we have missed some content that should have been included, for which we hereby preemptively apologize to readers (and authors).% and would encourage the authors of such work bring it to our attention.

One unifying point is that similar themes seem to have emerged independently using a number of different approaches and from scholarly communities who seem largely unaware of each others' existence and results.  Often quite different terminology has developed for ideas that are close cousins, and this may have hindered the ability of participants in ostensibly distant fields to recognize the common elements of their work.

For example, the work cited above on ``social learning'' in macroeconomics involved the propagation of competing ideas (forecasting rules) in a population.  This work satisfied our criteria that it addressed a substantive economic question using a mechanism by which beliefs were transmitted by explicit social interaction: The rules that work better, basically, are more infectious.  But the authors in this literature typically do not cast their models in epidemiological terms, nor do they typically propose testing the models by querying simulated agents about their simulated expectations, and comparing simulated expectations data to actual expectations data.  Doing so would not be a large leap.

Nor does this work take much notice of Shiller's longstanding view that economic dynamics reflect the competition of `narratives' that `go viral.'  The ``social learning'' model's  forecasting rules are arguably exactly how one might want to make a computational representation of what Shiller calls a narrative, and the economic dynamics that result from the increasing prevalence of the rules that succeed in the `tournaments' are a good candidate for a rigorous computational representation of the consequences of what might be meant by the claim that `narratives' can `go viral.'

Reciprocally, it does not seem that scholars interested in the ``narrative approach'' have embraced ``social learning in macroeconomics'' literature -- perhaps because papers in that literature usually do not describe the decisions the agents make as being a consequence of the ``narratives'' they have adopted to understand the world.

One of our ambitions for this survey is for it to infect scholars with the idea that it is useful to express the mechanisms of their models, as much as possible, in a common language drawn as much as possible from the familiar domains of epidemiological modeling and network theory:  Infectiousness, susceptibility, transmissibility, exposure, immunity, mixing, homophily, reproduction rates, degree distributions, clustering, and so on, in addition to whatever domain-specific terminology may be natural to their particular topic.
