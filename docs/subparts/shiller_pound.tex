Here, we provide a first example of an economic question formulated in a thoroughgoing epidemiological way.  Our purpose, here, is not to extract economic insights -- we do that in section~{\ref{subsec:assetprice}} below -- but simply to illustrate how the epidemiological toolkit works.

\href{https://github.com/iworld1991/EpiExp/blob/master/Literature/shiller1989survey.pdf}{\cite{shiller1989survey}}\footnote{This paper builds on the earlier work comparing the efficient market hypothesis of stock prices and an alternative model incorporating social dynamics \href{https://github.com/iworld1991/EpiExp/blob/master/Literature/shiller1984stock.pdf}{\citep{shiller1984stock}}. } use an SIR model to capture how the interest in particular stocks spreads in a population; we examine a model almost identical to theirs.\footnote{Our treatment makes two inconsequential modifications.  First, in order to be able to instantiate the model using the \href{https://ndlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{\texttt{NDLib}} computational toolkit described below, we rewrite the originally continuous-time model in a discrete-time form. Second, the original paper described an additional stochastic shock to the change in $I_t$ meant to capture a potential ``change in the `source' of the infection or the nature of the contagion.''  Because that shock was not actually used for any results in the paper, we neglect it in our exposition.}

At any date  $t$, a large population of investors of size $N$ is divided into three ``compartments.''  (See Figure \ref{fig:sir_diagram}).  $I_t$ represents investors who are currently ``infected'' with interest in a certain stock,  $S_t$ corresponds to investors who are not infected but are ``susceptible'' to becoming interested in the stock, and $R_t$ are investors who have been ``infected'' but have ``recovered'' from the infection.\footnote{The ``recovery'' compartment contains investors who have lost interest in the stock.  For our purposes here, we do not need to define the exact consequences of `recovery' -- like, whether it means that the person sells the stock.  See the original paper for further exposition.}

In each period, each person is expected to have contact with $\contactNum$ others, randomly selected from the entire population (this is the `random mixing' assumption mentioned above).  In the SIR framework, the only kind of contact with any consequence is between an infected person and a susceptible person: Such an encounter has a probability $\tranProb$ of causing the susceptible person to become infected.

Epidemiological models typically define a parameter $\beta$ that combines consequences of the rate of social contact $\contactNum$ and the rate of transmission upon such a contact, $\tranProb$:\footnote{In any extended SIR model embedding an explicitly defined connection network by which the ``disease'' spreads, the value of $\beta$ is equal to the product of the average number of connected nodes (``degree'' in the terminology of network theory), and the infection probability conditional on the contact. For instance, in a random graph (\cite{erdos1960evolution})  with connection probability $p$ and the size of network N, the average contacts every agent has is $(N-1)p$. See \cite{newman2002spread} and  \cite{jackson_social_2010} for the results from an SIR model augmented with various social networks.}
\begin{verbatimwrite}{./Equations/beta}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:beta}
    \beta  = \tranProb \contactNum.
\end{equation}
\end{verbatimwrite}
\input{./Equations/beta}

The expected number of new infections generated in period $t$ (corresponding to the decline in the number of susceptible persons) can now be calculated transparently: A fraction $S_{t}/N$ of an infected person's contacts will be susceptible, so the number of newly generated infections per infected person will be $\tranProb \times \contactNum \times (S_{t}/N).$

The population of infected persons also changes: Every infected person recovers with a probability of $\gamma$ per period.  Putting these elements together, the  changes in the population in different compartments are given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sirdyn}
	\begin{split}
	&	\Delta S_{t+1} = -\beta I_{t}(S_{t}/N) \\
	&	\Delta I_{t+1} = \beta \frac{S_{t}}{N}I_{t} - \gamma I_t \\
&		\Delta \Recovered_{t+1} = \gamma I_t
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

%The term $\beta \frac{S_{t}}{N}I_{t}$ captures the number of people who ``flow'' from ``compartment $S$'' to ``compartment $I$'', which is proportional to the infection rate $\beta$, the fraction of people who are susceptible $\frac{S_t}{N}$, and the number of the infected $I_t$. The  term $\gamma I_t$ captures the number of people who ``flow'' from $I$ to $\Recovered$

The simplest special case of the SIR model is one with a recovery rate of $\gamma=0$, in which case the model reduces to the transmissible SI model discussed in Section \ref{subsec:epi_framework}.  Another straightforward case is $\beta < \gamma$, in which from any starting point the population of infected persons $I$ gradually dies down to zero.

\newcommand{\Rzero}{\mathcal{R}(0)}
The interesting cases emerge when the `basic reproduction ratio' $\Rzero = (\beta/\gamma)$ exceeds one (this $\Rzero$ is unrelated to the $\Recovered$ used elsewhere to measure the recovered population), because $\Rzero > 1$ guarantees that an initial arbitrarily small infection will grow, at least for a while (assuming that at the beginning everyone is susceptible, $S_{0}/N = 1$).

To illustrate the model's implications in such a setting, we configure the model with four combinations of parameter values taken from \cite{shiller1989survey}, characterizing two different kinds of investors and two categories of stocks.  %(Section~\ref{subsec:assetprice} describes the investors and stock categories, and interprets the economics; here we confine our observations to the epidemiology.)

We explore the quantitative implications using one of the many computational toolkits for analyzing such models that have proliferated in recent years.\footnote{Specifically, we use the Python library NDlib (\cite{rossetti2018ndlib}) for the simulation of the SIR model here. The library builds upon another Python library called NetworkX (\cite{hagberg2008exploring}), a toolkit for analyzing complex networks.}  The toolkit lets users specify explicitly the network structure on which the disease spreads. We exploit the fact that a random-mixing SIR model can be approximated with a SIR model residing on an \textit{ex-ante} generated random graph (\cite{erdos1960evolution}) when the transmission probability $\tau$ and the average number of connections $\chi$ in the graph are configured such that their product is equal to the calibrated infection rate $\beta$ (see Equation \ref{eq:beta}).\footnote{See the companion \href{https://github.com/llorracc/EpiExp/blob/master/SIR_Ndlib.ipynb}{Jupyter Notebook} of this paper for detailed implementation.}

In Figure \ref{fig:sir_simulate} the vertical axis measures the proportions of Susceptible (dashed line), Infected (dash-dot line), and Recovered (solid line) investors, and elapsed time since the initial date of infection is on the horizontal axis.  Also plotted is the limiting size of the recovered compartment, for which an analytical solution exists.\footnote{Given a constant basic reproduction ratio $\beta/\gamma$ that is strictly greater than $1$, and an initial fraction $S_{0}/N$ close to 1, the limiting fraction of $\Recovered$, denoted as $\recovered_{+\infty} = \Recovered_{+\infty}/N$, is the solution to the implicit equation: $e^{-\frac{\beta}{\gamma} r_{+\infty}} = 1-r_{+\infty}$.  See  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology\#Transition_rates}{this Wikipedia page}, \cite{harko2014exact}, \href{{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/abc65d}}{\cite{kroger2020analytical}}, \cite{okabe2021microscopic} for details of the results.}

Two common patterns emerge from the simulation under these four sets of parameters of infection and recovery rates.  First, since in all four cases the basic reproduction ratio $\Rzero$ is greater than 1, in all four cases there is an outbreak. The size of the infected population first expands to its maximum value and then gradually levels off to zero, exhibiting a hump-shaped ``viral curve'' characteristic of SIR models.  Second, in all scenarios, the system ultimately converges to a steady-state where most of the people have cycled through infection and recovery, with a small proportion remaining susceptible. Even in the case with the smallest reproduction ratio, the proportion who cycle through the process of Infection and Recovery is almost 85 percent, implying a high degree of infectiousness. Under other configurations, the limiting size of the infected-then-recovered `compartment' $R$ is close to 100 percent.

The main difference in the parameterizations is the speed with which these eventualities play themselves out, which varies considerably.  (For the substantive interpretation of the model, see our discussion of its economic content in Section~\ref{subsec:assetprice}).

%Even using the results of their own surveys explicitly designed for the purpose, \cite{shiller1989survey} needed to exercise considerable ingenuity to produce the calibrations we have used above.

%We highlight~\cite{shiller1989survey} here because it presents an early but rich example that satisfies all our criteria for an epidemiological model of economic expectations. First, it articulates and a explicit structural mathematical mechanism by which an idea (in this case, interest in a stock) spreads in the population as a result of social communication. Second, the model has clear assumptions and predictions for both the micro and macro dynamics of expectations, which can be tested (or calibrated) with measurable survey data (indeed, they were calibrated with data that~\cite{shiller1989survey} collected themselves because existing sources had not asked the right questions).  Third (as we explain in section~{\ref{subsec:assetprice}}), dynamics of separately measurable economic phenomena (stock prices) are hypothesized to be a consequence of the dynamics of those expectations.  % Not many papers satisfy all these criteria.
