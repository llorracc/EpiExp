                Indeed, in ↓elds other than economics, the debates are rarely about whether social
                interactions are fundamental; the main question is which particular models for capturing
                social interactions are most suitable for understanding the spread of which kinds of
                ideas.

                exposure and susceptibility); (3) the understandability of information by the receiver
                (degree of immunity); and so on.
                <!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >      Arrow’s interpretation is the step that puts technological di↑usion squarely in the realm
                of EE modeling, under the mild further assumption articulated above: That what spreads is
                the ‘expectation’ that adoption of the technology will yield higher productivity
                (expectations were not explicitly modeled because Arrow’s seminal research predated the
                era when expectations were solicited on surveys; but expectational questions of
                exactly this kind have been asked in more recent work on di↑usion, see <span

                unsurprisingly con↓rm that people adopt a technology when they expect it to be

                evidence for word-of-mouth di↑usion of beliefs through a social network. The model
                di↑erentiates between agents who simply adopt the technology because they
                have heard about it from others (an ‘information passing mechanism’) and those
                who have adopted due to others’ participation (an ‘endorsement mechanism’).
                This is an example of how standard epidemiological models can be extended
                to incorporate alternative infection rules to accommodate more sophisticated
                applications.

                agents with higher productivity. (‘Learning’ in their model just means that, in an encounter
                between two agents, the agent with lower productivity adopts the other agent’s
                technology).
                <!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >      A particularly interesting feature of this model is that the agents solve an optimization

                economists may take epidemiological models: Incorporation of purposive behaviors by
                agents. While some work in epidemiology also allows agents to take actions to reduce the
                probability of infection, models in that literature have rarely been formulated with an eye
                to creating a structure where an explicit analytical optimization problem can be stated and

                disease spread through these connections, and as a result the dynamics of productivity and

                to having invested in a loser.

                to the simplest epidemiological model of ‘super-spreaders’ which occurs when
                some agents have many more social connections than others: The agents in this
                model di↑er in the degree of con↓dence they have in their opinions (whether
                optimistic or pessimistic) and those with greater con↓dence are more likely to
                convert those who have less con↓dence. De↓ning a ‘boom’ as a period in which
                house prices rise rapidly as the result of a spread in optimism, and a ‘bust’ as
                a rapid decline in prices caused by rising proportion of skepticism, their most
                interesting result is that whether a boom is followed by a bust can depend on whose
                opinion (optimists or skeptics) turns out to be closer to the true fundamental value.
                Speci↓cally, busts happen when the skeptics turn out to be right about the fundamentals,
                while booms caused by optimists who happen to be right are not followed by
                busts.

                in part because that literature has not mainly interpreted itself as modeling the dynamics of

                content of memes a↑ect their virality: racist and political memes are the most common

                to explain evidence that people seem to underreact to events that are not very
                surprising, but overreact to surprising events. While the authors attempt to capture this
                using a combination of ideas from Sims’s rational inattention framework and the
                Bordalo-Shleifer diagnostic expectations framework, to the extent that surprising events
                elicit emotional arousal, this paper may also be connected to the noneconomic literature
                just mentioned.
                <!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >      Some research in economics studies the spread of fake news and misinformation in a
                ‘market for news’ framework. <a 
href="https://github.com/iworld1991/EpiExp/blob/master/Literature/allcott2017social.pdf" ><span 
class="txb-">?</span></a> used a post-2016 election survey of 1200 U.S.
                adults to analyze the importance of social media on fake news consumption,
                exposure to fake news, and partisan composition. The paper highlights social media
                as one of the important (but not dominant) channels for the di↑usion of fake
                news. The paper constructs a model with a supply side of fake news provided by
                pro↓t-maximizing entities appealing to consumers subject to con↓rmation bias. This
                seems a natural extension of standard epidemiological models to incorporate
                the production side of the content { exploiting the \infectiousness” of certain
                ideas in subpopulations as an incentive for the production of content that the
                producers know will become \viral” because of a high reproductive number in the
                subpopulation.

class="txb-">?</span></a>,
                which builds a model of social learning with \forceful” agents who disregard information
                from other agents in the network. The presence of such agents may lead to the persistence
                of misinformation in equilibrium. The insight for epidemiological modeling is that
                heterogeneity in infectiousness can re&#x0027;ect characteristics of the sender (‘forcefulness’) as
                well as the receiver.
                <!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >      Epidemiological models have also been used to study patterns in the spread of scienti↓c
                ideas, in a separate literature outside of economics but closely related to the economic
                research on the di↑usion of technology. <a 
href="https://github.com/iworld1991/EpiExp/blob/master/Literature/bettencourt2006power.pdf" ><span

                of Feynman diagrams through theoretical physics communities. (See Figure <a 
href="#x3-27009r10">1.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:science_ideas_curve --></a>.) That
                paper uses an SEIR model where E represents the exposed state, and a SEIZ model
                where Z represents skeptics (mutually exclusive with being infected) who held
                competing ideas. Introducing skeptics generates an additional steady state of the
                model where competing ideas coexist. This di↑ers from two-compartment and
                three-compartment models, in which typically the system converges to a single
                state.

                few further points that did not neatly ↓t above.
                <!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >      First, common tools from epidemiological practice could usefully be imported into
                expectational surveys { particularly the deliberate e↑orts that epidemiologists
                make to determine the source of an infection (‘contact tracing’ being the most
                straightforward) { usually by asking direct questions. We would argue that, after a
                person’s expectations have been elicited, at least a small amount of extra time
                should sometimes be allocated to asking \why do you believe [x].” The respondent
                may not be able to give an answer, but in many cases they might have a useful
                response: \A friend told me” or \I read it in the newspaper” or \I did some
                research on the internet” or \I learned that from my parents when I was growing
                up.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="Book37.html#fn34x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">34</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x3-28001f34"></a> 
                Any of these answers (or potentially others) might prove very helpful in narrowing the set
                of models that are plausible for explaining any particular set of beliefs. Direct questions
                could also help distinguish between di↑erent kinds of information: A job seeker might
                learn from friends that job prospects have improved, which causes improved expectations.
                These same friends might also tell the job-seeker about a speci↓c current vacancy. If job
                seekers were directly asked separate questions about expectations and vacancy tips, it
                would be much easier to distinguish a mechanism in which optimistic job-seekers work
                harder to ↓nd jobs from a mechanism in which job vacancy tips are more frequent in
                periods when optimism is greater.
                <!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >      Above, we made mention of several kinds of evidence that information from some
                sources, or of some kinds, was more infectious. The literature on homophily, for
                example, suggests that ideas spread more readily among persons who have more in
                common. And even among social connections with otherwise-similar characteristics,
                some are likely to be more credible than others. Direct survey questions asking
                respondents which sources of information they ↓nd most persuasive, and why,
                might prove very helpful in thinking about the most appropriate structure for our
                models (and potentially even addressing problems like the Manski’s re&#x0027;ection
                problem.)
                <!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >      Epidemiological ideas might also prove to be useful in understanding how to interpret

                surveys asking people how they themselves would vote, and other results that suggest that
                it is easier to elicit prevalence of socially stigmatized behaviors or attitudes by asking
                respondents about prevalence among members of their social circles rather than asking the
                respondent about themselves. (\Are you a racist” does not elicit useful responses - and may
                even result in the termination of the survey; \how many of your friends would

                authors).
                <!--l. 542--><p class="indent" >      One unifying point is that similar themes seem to have emerged independently using a
                number of di↑erent approaches and from scholarly communities who seem largely
                unaware of each others’ existence and results. Often quite di↑erent terminology has

                participants in ostensibly distant ↓elds to recognize the common elements of their
                work.
                <!--l. 544--><p class="indent" >      For example, the work cited above on \social learning” in macroeconomics involved
                the propagation of competing ideas (forecasting rules) in a population. This work satis↓ed
                our criteria that it addressed a substantive economic question using a mechanism by which
                beliefs were transmitted by explicit social interaction: The rules that work better, basically,
                are more infectious. But the authors in this literature typically do not cast their models
                in epidemiological terms, nor do they typically propose testing the models by
                querying simulated agents about their simulated expectations, and comparing
                simulated expectations data to actual expectations data. Doing so would not be a large
                leap.

                model’s forecasting rules are arguably exactly how one might want to make a
                computational representation of what Shiller calls a narrative, and the economic
                dynamics that result from the increasing prevalence of the rules that succeed in the

                <!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Many of the obstacles, real and perceived, to the construction of what we call
                full-&#x0027;edged Epidemiological Expectations models have lessened over the last two
                decades.
                <!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >      A large body of evidence now ↓nds that opinions on economic questions are sharply
                heterogeneous, and that people’s choices are related to their opinions.
                <!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >      Data from social networks now provide the possibility of directly observing the
                operation of the key mechanisms of the social transmission of ideas { as has already been
                done in a few cases of economic models (and many more cases outside of economics).
                Other work, based not on social network data but on measures like geographical proximity
                or shared workplaces or common places of origin, has found further evidence of social
                transmission of ideas, while another strand of research has explored the ways
                in which news outlets can be modeled as a source of heterogeneity in beliefs
                if news stories have degrees of either exposure or infectiousness less than 100
                percent.
                <!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >      The recent successes achieved by the HA-Macro literature from the incorporation of
                realistic heterogeneity in non-expectational variables seem likely to tempt scholars to see
                what more can be accomplished by modeling expectational heterogeneity in ways based on
                empirically measured expectations.
                <!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >      An epidemiological expectations modeling approach is by no means applicable only to
                macroeconomic questions { the formation and consequences of expectations are at the
                heart of economic questions across the discipline. A particularly attractive direction that
                any literature written by economists is likely to take is to apply the discipline’s
                sophisticated tools for analyzing purposive behavior, as is done for example in the paper
                by <span 
class="txb-">? </span>whose agents optimally expose themselves to the possibility of infection with new
                ideas in the hopes of improving their productivity { something that scholars have done
                since time immemorial.
