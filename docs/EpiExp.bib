		  understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a
		  data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017.
		  About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people.
		  False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\%
		  of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000
		  people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000
		  people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The
		  degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients
		  may be responsible for the differences observed. Science,
		  this issue p. 1146 We investigated the differential
		  diffusion of all of the verified true and false news
		  stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data
		  comprise {\textasciitilde}126,000 stories tweeted by
		  {\textasciitilde}3 million people more than 4.5 million
		  times. We classified news as true or false using
		  information from six independent fact-checking
		  organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the
		  classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther,
		  faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all
		  categories of information, and the effects were more
		  pronounced for false political news than for false news
		  about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends,
		  or financial information. We found that false news was more
		  novel than true news, which suggests that people were more
		  likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories
		  inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true
		  stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust.
		  Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the
		  spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying
		  that false news spreads more than the truth because humans,
		  not robots, are more likely to spread it. A large-scale

  abstract	= {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of
		  epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor
		  which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude
		  of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost
		  every population. It was with a view to obtaining more
		  insight regarding the effects of the various factors which
		  govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present
		  investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to
		  the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same
		  problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a
		  further stage, and it is considered from a point of view
		  which is in one sense more general. The problem may be
		  summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is
		  introduced into a community of individuals, more or less
		  susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads
		  from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection.
		  Each infected person runs through the course of his
		  sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those
		  who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of
		  recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of
		  his illness. The chances that the affected may convey
		  infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the
		  stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number
		  of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced.
		  Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the
		  life of an individual, the population may be considered as
		  remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by
		  deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of
		  time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most
		  important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether
		  this termination occurs only when no susceptible
		  individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the
		  various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may
		  result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals
		  are still present in the unaffected population. It is
		  difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect.
		  In the present communication discussion will be limited to
		  the case in which all members of the community are
		  initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will
		  be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a
		  single infection.},

		  bestselling author Robert Shiller, a new way to think about
		  how popular stories help drive economic eventsIn a world in
		  which internet troll farms attempt to influence foreign
		  elections, can we afford to ignore the power of viral
		  stories to affect economies? In this groundbreaking book,
		  Nobel Prize–winning economist and New York Times
		  bestselling author Robert Shiller offers a new way to think
		  about the economy and economic change. Using a rich array
		  of historical examples and data, Shiller argues that
		  studying popular stories that affect individual and
		  collective economic behavior—what he calls "narrative
		  economics"—has the potential to vastly improve our
		  ability to predict, prepare for, and lessen the damage of
		  financial crises, recessions, depressions, and other major
		  economic events.Spread through the public in the form of
		  popular stories, ideas can go viral and move
		  markets—whether it's the belief that tech stocks can only
		  go up, that housing prices never fall, or that some firms
		  are too big to fail. Whether true or false, stories like
		  these—transmitted by word of mouth, by the news media,
		  and increasingly by social media—drive the economy by
		  driving our decisions about how and where to invest, how
		  much to spend and save, and more. But despite the obvious
		  importance of such stories, most economists have paid
		  little attention to them. Narrative Economics sets out to
		  change that by laying the foundation for a way of
		  understanding how stories help propel economic events that
		  have had led to war, mass unemployment, and increased
		  inequality.The stories people tell—about economic
		  confidence or panic, housing booms, the American dream, or
		  Bitcoin—affect economic outcomes. Narrative Economics
		  explains how we can begin to take these stories seriously.
		  It may be Robert Shiller's most important book to date.},

		  and protozoans) and the other with macroparasites
		  (helminths and parasitic arthropods). Each part begins with
		  simple models, developed in a biologically intuitive way,
		  and then goes on to develop more complicated and realistic
		  models as tools for public health planning. The book
		  synthesizes previous work in this rapidly growing field
		  (much of which is scattered between the ecological and the
		  medical literature) with a good deal of new material.},

  abstract	= {This paper develops first measures of housing sentiment
		  for 34 cities across the U.S. by quantifying the
		  qualitative tone of local housing news. I find that housing
		  media sentiment has significant predictive power for future
		  house prices, above and beyond his- torically predictive
		  factors and past returns. Sentiment leads price movements
		  by more than two years, and is highly correlated with
		  available survey expectations measures. The structure of
		  the media sentiment index itself reflects a
		  backward-looking nature consistent with extrapolative
		  expectations. Consistent with theories of sentiment, the
		  media sentiment index has a greater effect in markets with
		  more minority homebuyers, more speculative investors, and
		  across lower-priced homes. Including additional controls
		  for subprime lending and easy credit has no impact on the
		  magnitude of the results, but the predictive effect of
		  sentiment is amplified in markets where more subprime loans
		  were issued. Directly investigating the content across news
		  articles finds that results are not driven by news stories
		  of unobserved fundamentals.},

		  amplify and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on
		  the U.S. Great Recession of 2007-2009 and proceed in two
		  steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income
		  Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income,
		  consumption and wealth inequality before and during the
		  Great Recession. We then investigate how households in
		  different segments of the wealth distribution were affected
		  by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures
		  differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by
		  this evidence, we study several variants of a standard
		  heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an
		  endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
		  finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify
		  the impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the
		  distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of
		  households with very little net worth that sharply increase
		  their saving (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the
		  recession hits. We document that both these features are
		  observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that
		  social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance,
		  play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
		  distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business
		  cycles.},
